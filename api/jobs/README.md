# @nestarc/jobs

Tenant-aware background jobs for NestJS.

This package provides:

- `JobsModule.forInMemory()` for single-process apps and tests with weighted tenant fairness
- `JobsModule.forBullMQ()` for Redis-backed queues using BullMQ's standard `Worker`
- ALS-style context capture and restore through `contextExtractor` and `contextRunner`
- `@JobHandler()` discovery through Nest provider scanning
- `createOutboxJobsPublisher()` for first-party `@nestarc/outbox` delivery into jobs
- `JobsOutboxBridge` for legacy, generic outbox-like sources
- `FakeJobsService` for deterministic tests without Redis
- typed contracts, lifecycle events, retry/backoff, idempotency, and explicit backend capabilities

## Status

Published package version: `0.3.1`. This source checkout contains the unreleased `0.4.0` maintenance candidate; manifest versioning and publication are gated separately.

## Install

Core package:

```bash
npm install @nestarc/jobs
```

If you use the BullMQ backend, install BullMQ too:

```bash
npm install bullmq
```

If you use the first-party outbox publisher, install the matching outbox package:

```bash
npm install @nestarc/outbox
```

Peer expectations:

- Node.js `22` or `24` for the 0.4 candidate (Node 20 support ends with the 0.3 line)
- NestJS `^10` or `^11`
- BullMQ `^5.76.2` when using `forBullMQ()`
- Optional `@nestarc/outbox ^0.2.1 || ^0.3.0` when using `createOutboxJobsPublisher()`; exact 0.2.1 and 0.3.0 consumer gates
- `reflect-metadata`
- `rxjs`

### Nest 11 + Prisma 7 Outbox consumer gate

Jobs does not have a direct Prisma peer. Prisma compatibility for the first-party publisher is
therefore verified against the actual `@nestarc/outbox` package artifact. The existing
`@nestarc/outbox ^0.2.1 || ^0.3.0` peer retains the Prisma 7-ready `0.2.1` anchor; the separate candidate lane validates `0.3.0`. The anchor does not require a Jobs
release.

Run the strict tarball consumer with an explicit candidate or published artifact:

```bash
OUTBOX_PACKAGE=/absolute/path/nestarc-outbox-0.2.1.tgz \
  npm run test:consumer:modern
```

The gate refuses npm force/legacy peer bypasses, installs exact NestJS `11.2.1` and Prisma
`7.10.0`, compiles against the real Outbox transport types with `skipLibCheck` disabled, and runs
an Outbox-to-Jobs enqueue smoke test. CI can run the same gate through the `modern_outbox_package`
manual workflow input once the artifact is reachable from the runner. Normal CI detects and starts
requiring exact `@nestarc/outbox@0.2.1` as soon as that release is published; Jobs releases require
it unconditionally.

## Choose a backend

### In-memory backend

Use `forInMemory()` when:

- you run a single Nest process
- tenant fairness matters
- you want the simplest local or test setup

Important behavior:

- workers start automatically when the Nest module initializes
- tenant fairness is enforced by the in-process `Scheduler`
- this backend is not distributed across multiple processes
- shutdown closes admission first, then drains accepted active, queued, delayed, and retrying work before destroying feature dependencies
- `shutdown: { timeoutMs: 30_000 }` sets the graceful drain deadline (30 seconds by default; positive integer up to 2,147,483,647)
- enqueue (including dedupe acknowledgement) and dead-letter replay during/after shutdown reject with `jobs_backend_closed`

If drain exceeds its deadline, `app.close()` rejects with `JobsShutdownError`
(`code: 'jobs_shutdown_incomplete'`, `reason: 'deadline'`, `remainingJobIds`,
`remainingCount`). Admission stays closed; records and identity mappings remain
available while drain continues in the background. A later `app.close()` joins the
same drain with a new deadline. Backend resources close exactly once after all
accepted work and outstanding handler invocations finish. Successful close releases
in-memory records and history. This is a pre-1.0 minor behavior change, planned for
0.4.0; it does not add crash durability.

A handler that ignores `ctx.signal` retains its slot until its actual promise
settles. Timeout emits `job.timed_out` and aborts the signal immediately; the job
stays active until settlement, then records timeout failure and schedules any retry.
Late success cannot turn a timeout into success. A never-settling handler prevents
graceful completion. Observe the shutdown error, arrange cooperative handler
settlement, or explicitly terminate the process knowing that in-memory work is
lost. Administrative cancellation changes logical state but cannot stop JavaScript
or make shutdown treat an outstanding invocation as finished. Delivery remains
at-least-once; side effects are not exactly-once.

Stop upstream producers before closing Jobs. Handler follow-up enqueue during drain
also rejects; applications that relied on it must move production before admission
closes or handle the rejection. Nest shutdown ordering drains Jobs before feature
provider destruction in Nest 10 and 11. A co-located Outbox poller must stop before
Jobs admission closes; this change does not coordinate its separate shutdown hooks.

For standalone `InMemoryBackend`/`FairWorker` use, call `beginClose()` to stop
admission, drain workers (including future schedules), await `waitForIdle()` on
all workers, then call `backend.close()`. `outstandingJobIds()` reports worker-owned
invocations; `pendingJobIds()` reports backend nonterminal records. A direct backend
`close()` cannot run handlers and rejects with `JobsShutdownError` and
`reason: 'pending_jobs'` if nonterminal records remain. Explicitly cancel/disposition
those records or finish processing them before retrying close. Backend-only close
cannot observe externally owned handler promises, so their owner must await them.

### BullMQ backend

Use `forBullMQ()` when:

- you need Redis-backed persistence and BullMQ workers
- FIFO delivery is acceptable for now

Important behavior:

- jobs are processed by BullMQ's standard `Worker`
- tenant fairness is not implemented in `0.3.0`
- fairness-only APIs such as `setTenantWeight()` and `scheduler()` throw on this backend
- pull-based backend methods such as `peekWaiting()` and `moveToActive()` are unsupported on this backend
- `namespace` must not contain `.`, while declared job types such as `email.send` may contain dots
- registered job types are opened during module creation, so status lookup and consumption survive app restarts
- Nest shutdown waits for active handlers and closes BullMQ workers and queues automatically

## Quickstart: In-memory

```ts
import 'reflect-metadata';
import { Injectable, Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { JobHandler, JobsModule } from '@nestarc/jobs';

@Injectable()
class ReportHandler {
  @JobHandler('sendReport')
  async handle(payload: { userId: string }, ctx: { tenantId?: string }): Promise<void> {
    console.log('tenant', ctx.tenantId, 'user', payload.userId);
  }
}

@Module({
  imports: [
    JobsModule.forInMemory({
      jobTypes: ['sendReport'],
      fairness: { defaultWeight: 1, minSharePct: 0.1 },
      concurrency: { poolSize: 10, tenantCap: 10, typeCap: 10 },
    }),
  ],
  providers: [ReportHandler],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Then enqueue with `JobsService`:

```ts
await jobs.enqueue(
  'sendReport',
  { userId: 'u1' },
  {
    context: { tenantId: 'tenant-a' },
  },
);
```

## Quickstart: BullMQ

```ts
import 'reflect-metadata';
import { Injectable, Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { BullMQBackend, JobHandler, JobsModule } from '@nestarc/jobs';

@Injectable()
class ReportHandler {
  @JobHandler('sendReport')
  async handle(payload: { userId: string }): Promise<void> {
    console.log(payload.userId);
  }
}

const backend = new BullMQBackend({
  namespace: 'acme',
  connection: { host: '127.0.0.1', port: 6379 },
  workerConcurrency: 10,
});

@Module({
  imports: [
    JobsModule.forBullMQ({
      backend,
      jobTypes: ['sendReport'],
    }),
  ],
  providers: [ReportHandler],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

On BullMQ, jobs are delivered FIFO by BullMQ's worker. Context and metadata are persisted in Redis and restored after restart, but tenant fairness is not applied.

### Upgrading BullMQ deployments from 0.2

BullMQ deployments must not run `0.2.x` and `0.3.x` producers or workers against the same queues at the same time. Version 0.3 uses a new persisted envelope, generated idempotency IDs, and worker-side backoff strategy that version 0.2 does not understand.

Use a coordinated upgrade:

1. Stop all 0.2 producers and workers.
2. Deploy 0.3 to every producer and worker.
3. Resume production only after every process runs 0.3.

Version 0.3 rejects a dotted BullMQ namespace when the backend is constructed. If a 0.2 deployment uses one, drain or explicitly migrate its existing queues and switch to a dot-free namespace before starting 0.3; changing the namespace changes the BullMQ queue names and identity keyspace. Dots in job types remain supported.

Version 0.3 workers can consume jobs that were already queued by version 0.2, and they adopt an existing v0.2 raw idempotency job when it is present. If v0.2 used the same raw idempotency key in multiple job-type queues, each queue adopts its own job while a shared legacy claim continues to block a new explicit job from reusing that raw ID. Direct status lookup by that duplicated legacy raw ID remains inherently ambiguous and returns the first matching registered queue; queue processing and job-type-scoped idempotent enqueue remain independent. This backward-read support does not make mixed-version rolling operation safe.

## Typed job contracts

The optional TypeScript contract layer preserves existing string-based APIs. Job defaults are applied at runtime, with enqueue options taking precedence. Pass the definitions through the `jobs` option of `JobsModule.forInMemory()` or `JobsModule.forBullMQ()` to enable those runtime defaults.

```ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { defineJobs, InjectJobs, job, JobsModule, type TypedJobsService } from '@nestarc/jobs';

export const appJobs = defineJobs({
  'email.send': job<{ messageId: string }>()
    .context<{ tenantId: string }>()
    .result<void>()
    .defaults({ attempts: 3 }),
});

type AppJobs = typeof appJobs;

class Mailer {
  constructor(@InjectJobs() private readonly jobs: TypedJobsService<AppJobs>) {}

  send(): Promise<string> {
    return this.jobs.enqueue(
      'email.send',
      { messageId: 'msg_1' },
      {
        context: { tenantId: 'tenant_1' },
      },
    );
  }
}

@Module({
  imports: [
    JobsModule.forInMemory({
      jobs: appJobs,
      jobTypes: Object.keys(appJobs),
    }),
  ],
  providers: [Mailer],
})
export class MailJobsModule {}
```

## Context propagation

`JobsService.enqueue()` stores context under an internal reserved key and restores it before invoking the handler.

You can plug in your own context system:

```ts
JobsModule.forInMemory({
  jobTypes: ['sendReport'],
  events: {
    onEvent: (event) => logger.info(event, 'job lifecycle'),
  },
  contextExtractor: () => ({
    tenantId: tenancy.currentTenantId(),
    requestId: requestScope.currentRequestId(),
  }),
  contextRunner: (ctx, fn) => tenancy.run(ctx, fn),
});
```

Notes:

- payloads and contexts must be plain objects; primitives, arrays, functions, built-ins such as
  `Date`/`Map`, and class instances are rejected before enqueue
- use `Record<string, never>` for a typed job with an intentionally empty payload
- payloads must not contain the reserved keys `__nestarcCtx` or `__nestarcJob`
- if you do not provide a context extractor, the default context is `{}`
- the in-memory backend snapshots payload, context, metadata, and backoff inputs; later producer or
  handler mutation does not change the stored job record

## Handler discovery

`JobsModule` scans Nest providers for methods decorated with `@JobHandler(jobType)`.
Discovery runs during Nest application bootstrap, after provider construction and all
`onModuleInit()` hooks have completed. The in-memory polling loop and BullMQ consumers start only
after discovery finishes, so jobs queued before `app.init()` remain queued until handlers are
registered. In tests or standalone application contexts, call `app.init()`; `compile()` alone does
not start consumers.

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { JobHandler, type TypedJobHandler } from '@nestarc/jobs';

type AppJobs = typeof appJobs;

@Injectable()
export class EmailHandler implements TypedJobHandler<AppJobs, 'email.send'> {
  @JobHandler('email.send')
  async handle(payload: { messageId: string }, ctx: { tenantId: string }): Promise<void> {
    // do work
  }
}
```

Decorator handlers must be singleton providers with a static dependency tree. Request-scoped and
transient handlers (including singleton handlers that depend on a request-scoped tree) fail during
bootstrap with an actionable error. Use the public `HandlerRegistry.register()` API when handler
resolution must be managed dynamically.

If no handler is registered for a job type, the library throws `jobs_handler_not_found`.

## JobsService API

Primary service methods:

- `enqueue(jobType, payload, opts?)`
- `enqueueDetailed(jobType, payload, opts?)`
- `getJob(jobId)`
- `getJobHistory(jobId)`
- `capabilities()`
- `listDeadLetters(filter?)`
- `replayDeadLetter(jobId, opts?)`
- `discardDeadLetter(jobId, reason?)`
- `setTenantWeight(jobType, tenantId, weight)`
- `scheduler(jobType)`

`EnqueueOptions`:

- `jobId?: string`
- `context?: JobContext`
- `delay?: number`
- `delayMs?: number`
- `scheduledFor?: Date`
- `attempts?: number`
- `backoff?: { type: 'fixed'; delayMs: number; jitter?: number } | { type: 'exponential'; delayMs: number; maxDelayMs?: number; jitter?: number }`
- `timeoutMs?: number`
- `idempotencyKey?: string`
- `dedupe?: { key: string; scope?: 'global' | 'tenant'; ttlMs?: number; mode?: 'while_active' | 'until_completed' }`
- `metadata?: Record<string, unknown>`

Behavior notes:

- `jobType` must be declared in the module or service setup
- `setTenantWeight()` and `scheduler()` are only available on fairness-enabled backends
- `enqueue()` still returns `Promise<string>` for compatibility
- `enqueueDetailed()` returns whether a job was created or deduped
- retries are opt-in; default `attempts` is `1`
- negative or non-finite backoff values normalize to `0`; a finite `maxDelayMs` still caps exponential
  overflow, while a final non-finite exponential or jitter result normalizes to `0`
- handler timeout uses cooperative cancellation through `ctx.signal` on the in-memory backend
- BullMQ rejects `timeoutMs`, history, DLQ helpers, and manual drain with `jobs_capability_unsupported`
- lifecycle callbacks are observational; thrown errors and rejected promises do not alter enqueue or handler outcomes
- BullMQ producer and worker events can cross process boundaries; consumers that merge events from
  multiple processes should use timestamps and terminal-state precedence rather than arrival order

## Status, retry, idempotency, and DLQ

```ts
const jobId = await jobs.enqueue('deliverWebhook', payload, {
  context: { tenantId },
  attempts: 5,
  backoff: { type: 'exponential', delayMs: 1_000, maxDelayMs: 60_000 },
  idempotencyKey: deliveryId,
});

const record = await jobs.getJob(jobId);
const history = await jobs.getJobHistory(jobId);
```

When attempts are exhausted, the in-memory backend moves the job to `dead_letter` by default.

```ts
const failed = await jobs.listDeadLetters({ type: 'deliverWebhook' });
const replayedJobId = await jobs.replayDeadLetter(failed[0].id);

// Alternatively, discard the job instead of replaying it:
// await jobs.discardDeadLetter(failed[0].id, 'handled manually');
```

In-memory replay preserves and rebinds the original idempotency/dedupe identity to the replayed job. Attempts reset by default for a new replay ID; pass `{ resetAttempts: false }` to retain the recorded attempt count. With `{ preserveOriginalId: true }`, the lifetime attempt count never resets. By default a fresh retry budget is added to that count (`maxAttempts` becomes the cumulative ceiling), and backoff starts at the first attempt of the replay generation. `resetAttempts: false` retains the previous ceiling and backoff position. A successful discard emits `job.discarded`; repeated, missing, or non-dead-letter discard calls are no-ops and emit nothing.

Tenant-scoped dedupe requires a tenant id:

```ts
await jobs.enqueueDetailed('generateReport', payload, {
  context: { tenantId },
  dedupe: { key: `report:${reportId}`, scope: 'tenant' },
});
```

Identity and dedupe keys are scoped to a job type; `scope: 'global'` means across tenants of that type. `while_active` always releases at a terminal state, and `ttlMs` does not shorten that active window. For `until_completed`, `ttlMs` permits a new identity only after the retained job is terminal and the TTL has elapsed. The mode and TTL stored by the active identity remain authoritative until that identity is released, so a rolling configuration change cannot weaken an existing dedupe window. These are duplicate-enqueue controls, not exactly-once execution guarantees.

For BullMQ jobs carrying v0.3 dedupe metadata, terminal worker events make a best-effort attempt to delete `while_active` mappings and start the configured `until_completed` TTL at the terminal transition. Enqueue-time reconciliation remains the fallback if that cleanup cannot complete.

When one supplied identity matches a job and the other identity is unused, both identities are bound to that job. If the supplied identities already resolve to different jobs, enqueue fails with `jobs_identity_conflict`; the library does not silently replace an active mapping.

## Tenant fairness

The in-memory backend uses a shard-based scheduler with:

- per-tenant waiting queues
- weighted dispatch
- `minSharePct` starvation protection
- per-tenant inflight caps
- due-time promotion for delayed jobs and retries

In-memory automatic execution uses a bounded pool shared by every job type in one
`JobsModule.forInMemory()` registration. `concurrency.poolSize` (default `10`) limits
all outstanding invocations; `tenantCap` (default `10`) limits one tenant across
all types; `typeCap` (default `poolSize`) limits each type. All three must be
positive safe integers. Types take turns acquiring free slots; within a type,
weighted tenant selection and minimum share apply only to eligible tenants.
Weights govern dispatch opportunities, not elapsed CPU time, and cannot override
any concurrency cap. Use `poolSize: 1` to preserve the earlier serial execution.
These are local limits, independently applied by each module/process.

A timed-out invocation retains every slot until its handler settles. Shutdown
uses the same pool and limits while draining queued, delayed and retrying jobs.
A backend worker-loop failure releases capacity after the invocation settles,
stops automatic dispatch, and makes shutdown report `worker_error` with pending
IDs. Backend state reconciliation/restart after that error remains an explicit
recovery action. There is no automatic retry of an uncertain backend transition.

BullMQ `workerConcurrency` (default `10`) is per job-type Worker in each backend
instance: `N` registered types can execute up to `N × workerConcurrency` handlers
per process. Multiple processes add their own workers. It has no shared Jobs
pool, per-tenant fairness or cross-type global bound; the in-memory concurrency
options do not apply to BullMQ. No distributed bound is implied.

Missing tenant identity uses an internal Symbol shard, separate from every user
string, including `__default__`. Contexts, lifecycle events, scheduler picks and
snapshots expose the missing tenant as `undefined`. Enqueue, retry, replay and
weight controls use this same identity. `setTenantWeight(type, undefined, weight)`
controls the system shard; passing `'__default__'` controls that real tenant only.
Tenant IDs follow the string contract below; no user string namespace is reserved.

Future work stays outside weighted dispatch and starvation accounting until it is due, so it does not block ready work from the same or another tenant. Scheduler snapshots still include deferred work in each tenant's `waiting` count. `defaultWeight` and standalone scheduler `tenantCap` must be positive safe integers, `minSharePct` must be finite and within `[0, 1]`, and runtime tenant weights must be non-negative safe integers (`0` is allowed); invalid values throw `jobs_fairness_misconfig`.

You can adjust weights at runtime:

```ts
jobs.setTenantWeight('sendReport', 'enterprise-tenant', 3);
jobs.setTenantWeight('sendReport', 'free-tenant', 1);
```

For lower-level inspection:

```ts
const snapshot = jobs.scheduler('sendReport').snapshot();
```

### Enqueue validation and portable values (planned 0.4.0)

`JobsService`, effective job defaults, and direct InMemory/BullMQ enqueue calls
validate before storing jobs or reserving identities. Invalid options/configuration
throw `JobsError` with `code: 'jobs_invalid_input'`; unsupported valid capabilities
still throw `jobs_capability_unsupported`. Invalid recursive data uses
`jobs_serialization_invalid`. Payload envelope keys `__nestarcCtx` and
`__nestarcJob` remain reserved (`jobs_reserved_payload_key`). Direct backends take
an envelope from `attachContext(payload, context)`; its context is authoritative.

- Attempts and concurrency are positive safe integers. Delay (`delay`/`delayMs`),
  dedupe TTL and backoff delay/maxDelay are finite milliseconds in `[0, 2147483647]`;
  timeout is in `[1, 2147483647]`. Fractional durations are accepted; timers apply
  their millisecond resolution. A valid `scheduledFor: Date` may be in the past,
  or at most `2147483647` ms into the future. Precedence remains
  `scheduledFor`, then `delayMs`, then `delay`.
- Job types are non-blank strings of at most 256 UTF-16 code units, without `:`;
  job IDs, idempotency/dedupe keys and tenant IDs are non-blank strings of at most
  1024 code units. Values are preserved exactly, without trimming or coercion.
  Registered job types must be unique; an empty registration remains valid.
- Dedupe scope is exactly `global` or `tenant`, and mode is exactly `while_active`
  or `until_completed`. Tenant scope requires a tenant. Generic omitted scope
  remains global; the first-party Outbox adapter retains its tenant-safe default.
  Backoff type is exactly `fixed` or `exponential`, with jitter in `[0, 1]`.
  Exponential arithmetic saturates at the maximum timer delay instead of
  overflowing into an immediate retry.
- Payload, context and metadata roots are plain records. Nested plain records,
  arrays, strings, booleans, null and finite numbers are supported. Valid Date
  values normalize to ISO strings, object properties valued `undefined` are
  omitted, array holes/undefined become null, and negative zero becomes zero.
  Caller values are snapshotted before asynchronous admission.
- Nested BigInt, functions, symbols/symbol keys, Map, Set, Buffer, custom class or
  array prototypes, accessors, cycles, invalid Dates and nonfinite numbers are
  rejected. Repeated references without cycles are allowed. Enumerable data is
  traversed without calling getters or custom `toJSON`; non-enumerable properties
  are excluded. Handler `context.signal` remains a non-enumerable runtime field.
- The envelope and metadata each have a conservative 1 MiB UTF-8 traversal budget
  (including keys/separators) and at most 64 nesting levels from their root.
  Oversized or deeper inputs fail before admission. Convert binary/class values
  explicitly and adapt handlers that previously expected nested Date instances
  to receive ISO strings. The same normalized values reach both backends.

## First-party outbox publisher

Use the publisher factory as the `@nestarc/outbox` transport. Publishing resolves only after Redis or in-memory enqueue succeeds, so mapping and enqueue failures remain retryable by the outbox poller.

```ts
import { OutboxModule } from '@nestarc/outbox';
import { createOutboxJobsPublisher } from '@nestarc/jobs';
import { PrismaService } from './prisma.service';

const JobsPublisher = createOutboxJobsPublisher({
  map: {
    'invoice.issued': { job: 'invoice.process' },
    'system.reindex_requested': {
      job: 'system.reindex',
      tenant: 'optional',
    },
  },
});

OutboxModule.forRoot({
  prisma: PrismaService,
  transport: JobsPublisher,
  delivery: { mode: 'publisher' },
});
```

The adapter sets both `jobId` and `idempotencyKey` to the outbox record ID. It preserves `tenantId`, `outboxEventId`, `correlationId` (falling back to the event ID), and optional `causationId` in context and metadata. Missing mappings, including inherited object property names, and missing required tenants fail closed by default. Delivery remains at-least-once; retain BullMQ terminal job records for at least the outbox retry and operator-recovery horizon.

For tenant-bearing events, mapping-level `dedupe: { key }` defaults to `scope: 'tenant'`
using the resolved tenant. Two tenants with the same key enqueue separate jobs. To intentionally
collapse work across tenants of a job type, set `dedupe: { key, scope: 'global' }` explicitly.
A `tenant: 'optional'` event without a tenant retains global dedupe; explicit tenant-scoped dedupe
without a tenant fails closed. The generic `JobsService` dedupe default remains global.

A successful `publish()` acknowledges enqueue or duplicate suppression. Outbox `SENT` does not
mean the Jobs handler succeeded. A suppressed event may have no separate job under its record ID;
the retained job keeps its original record ID as both `jobId` and `idempotencyKey`.

Context fields `tenantId`, `outboxEventId`, `correlationId`, and `causationId` are source-owned.
Metadata fields `source`, `outboxEventId`, `outboxEventType`, `tenantId`, `correlationId`,
`causationId`, `aggregateType`, `aggregateId`, `partitionKey`, `outboxIdempotencyKey`,
`outboxHeaders`, and `outboxOccurredAt` are also reserved. Mapping values for these fields are
removed before source lineage is applied, including when a source value is absent. Other custom
context and metadata fields are preserved. Only an explicit `target.tenant` function can remap
the tenant. Source identity and lineage (including headers and occurrence time) are snapshotted
before mapping callbacks run, so mutating a callback's record cannot replace canonical lineage.

## Legacy generic bridge

`JobsOutboxBridge` remains available for compatibility with generic sources that expose `onEvent()`; it is not the `@nestarc/outbox` publisher transport.

```ts
import { JobsOutboxBridge } from '@nestarc/jobs';

new JobsOutboxBridge({
  jobs,
  source: outboxSource,
  map: {
    'data_subject.erasure_requested': 'handleErasure',
    'webhook.delivery_due': 'deliverWebhook',
  },
});
```

The bridge forwards `event.tenantId` by default. You can override it:

```ts
new JobsOutboxBridge({
  jobs,
  source: outboxSource,
  map: { 'report.ready': 'sendReport' },
  tenantFrom: (event) => `tenant:${event.tenantId}`,
});
```

The bridge only uses own properties of `map`; inherited names such as `toString`, `constructor`, or `__proto__` are treated as unmapped and ignored.

## Testing

Use `FakeJobsService` when you want deterministic tests without Redis.

```ts
import { FakeJobsService } from '@nestarc/jobs';

it('processes a job', async () => {
  const fake = new FakeJobsService({
    jobTypes: ['sendReport'],
    tenantCap: 2,
    defaultWeight: 1,
    minSharePct: 0.1,
  });

  fake.registry.register('sendReport', async (payload, ctx) => {
    expect(ctx.tenantId).toBe('tenant-a');
    expect(payload).toEqual({ userId: 'u1' });
  });

  await fake.service.enqueue(
    'sendReport',
    { userId: 'u1' },
    {
      context: { tenantId: 'tenant-a' },
    },
  );

  await fake.drain();
});
```

For delayed jobs and retry tests, use `createFakeJobs()` with its deterministic clock:

```ts
import { createFakeJobs } from '@nestarc/jobs';

it('advances delayed work deterministically', async () => {
  const fake = createFakeJobs({
    jobTypes: ['webhook.deliver'],
    now: new Date('2026-06-20T00:00:00.000Z'),
  });

  fake.registry.register('webhook.deliver', async () => undefined);

  const jobId = await fake.service.enqueue(
    'webhook.deliver',
    { deliveryId: 'del_1' },
    {
      delayMs: 1_000,
    },
  );

  await fake.drainUntilIdle();
  fake.clock.advanceBy(1_000);
  await fake.drainUntilIdle();
  expect(await fake.service.getJob(jobId)).toMatchObject({ status: 'succeeded' });
});
```

When production uses typed runtime defaults, pass the same definitions as `jobs` so the fake applies identical attempts, backoff, and timeout values.

```ts
const fake = createFakeJobs({
  jobs: appJobs,
  jobTypes: Object.keys(appJobs),
});
```

## Low-level exports

The package also exports lower-level building blocks for custom composition:

- `JobsService`
- `HandlerRegistry`
- `Scheduler`
- `FairWorker`
- `InMemoryBackend`
- `BullMQBackend`
- `createOutboxJobsPublisher()`
- `JobsOutboxBridge`
- `attachContext()`
- `detachContext()`
- `CONTEXT_KEY`
- `INTERNAL_JOB_KEY`
- `JOBS_BACKEND`
- `JOBS_WORKERS`

## Error codes

The library exposes these error codes through `JobsError`:

- `jobs_reserved_payload_key`
- `jobs_handler_not_found`
- `jobs_queue_not_found`
- `jobs_fairness_misconfig`
- `jobs_capability_unsupported`
- `jobs_backend_closed`
- `jobs_identity_conflict`

## Limitations

- In-memory fairness is process-local and intended for single-process execution.
- BullMQ tenant fairness is not implemented.
- BullMQ backend does not support pull-based fairness operations such as `peekWaiting()` or `moveToActive()`.
- Fairness control APIs are unavailable on BullMQ in this release.
- BullMQ durable history, timeout, and DLQ list/replay/discard are intentionally reported as unsupported.

## Development

Useful scripts:

```bash
npm run build
npm test
docker compose -f docker-compose.redis.yml up -d
REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:16379 npm run test:redis
REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:16379 npm run test:coverage
npm run lint
```

Release flow:

1. Update the package version and changelog, then run the local verification above with a clean worktree.
2. Push the release commit to `main` and wait for its CI run to pass.
3. Confirm the exact release commit is present on remote `main`.
4. Create and push a matching `v<package-version>` tag from that commit.
5. GitHub Actions runs the same Node/Nest/Redis/package verification used by pull requests, then publishes that verified tarball through trusted publishing and creates a GitHub release.

The npm trusted publisher is configured for:

- Publisher: GitHub Actions
- Repository: `nestarc/jobs`
- Workflow filename: `release.yml`
- Environment: `npm`
- Allowed action: `npm publish`

### Custom backend activation contract (planned 0.4.0)

`FairWorker` requires `capabilities().activationFencing === true`. A custom backend
must generate a fresh, opaque `activationId` on every successful `moveToActive`,
return it on the envelope, and atomically validate it with the active state for
`ack(jobType, jobId, activationId)` and
`fail(jobType, jobId, reason, activationId)`. Direct in-memory `markFailed` takes
the token before its optional error summary. Do not infer the token from the latest
job state: carry the token from the invocation being completed. Legacy custom
backends must implement this contract before opting into the capability; the worker
fails at construction if the capability is absent. BullMQ keeps its own worker lock
contract and does not use these manual completion APIs.

| Current state | Operation | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| queued / due delayed | moveToActive | active, fresh token, attempt +1 |
| future delayed / active / terminal / missing | moveToActive | null; no mutation |
| active with matching token | ack | succeeded |
| active with matching token | fail / markFailed | retry scheduled, failed, or dead letter according to budget |
| missing / non-active / wrong type / stale or absent token | ack / fail / markFailed | `jobs_activation_conflict`; no history or budget mutation |
| queued / delayed / active | markCancelled | cancelled; late completions conflict |
| terminal | markCancelled | unchanged; no new history |
| dead_letter | explicit replay / discard | new replay generation / cancelled |

Duplicate and opposite terminal completions both conflict. Only explicit dead-letter
administration can leave a terminal state; a same-ID replay creates a new activation
and preserves monotonic attempt history. The public backend signature, lifecycle
event union, same-ID replay accounting, and shutdown defaults require a 0.4.0 minor
release. The package version is advanced by the separate release task.

## Additional 0.4 maintenance contracts

### Producer and worker applications

```ts
JobsModule.forBullMQ({ backend, jobTypes: ['invoice.process'], role: 'producer' });
JobsModule.forBullMQ({ backend, jobTypes: ['invoice.process'], role: 'worker' });
```

The default role is `both`. Producer applications never create BullMQ Workers or discover handlers. Worker and both applications validate every intended handler at bootstrap. Register handlers before `app.init()`, or explicitly choose `dynamicRegistration: true` and arrange registration before any queued work can run. Worker-only JobsService rejects enqueue; use `both` for handlers that enqueue follow-up work. Every role closes its backend resources.

In-memory backend faults retry the same activation and settled outcome after 50ms. `onWorkerError` observes faults without stopping all dispatch. A transport error after ack never triggers fail. Custom backends should honor the optional caller-supplied activation token in `moveToActive(type, id, token)` to reconcile activation response loss. Shutdown continues to report unresolved IDs if the backend remains unavailable.

`FakeJobsService.drain()` and `drainUntilIdle()` reject with `jobs_drain_limit_exceeded` when their iteration budget leaves schedulable work. Future-delayed idle is successful; advance the FakeClock to make that work due. Cancelled scheduler entries no longer hide ready jobs behind them. History reads return independent entries, dates and errors.

### Retention and operator cleanup

Retention is disabled by default. Configure it on `InMemoryBackend`, `JobsModule.forInMemory`, or `BullMQBackend`:

```ts
retention: {
  terminalAgeMs: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
  recoveryHorizonMs: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
  batchSize: 1000,
}
```

Choose the horizon from the longest Outbox retry plus manual recovery window. It is a safety floor; cleanup never shortens it to meet a count target. Stop all producer processes and administrative retry/replay writers, wait for workers to become idle, then call `await backend.pruneTerminal({ producersStopped: true })` until it returns zero. The boolean is the operator's assertion about other processes. BullMQ pauses registered queues and restores their previous pause states; register every relevant job type first. Cleanup removes expired terminal payload/context/metadata/history and matching identities, preserving mappings rebound to live replay jobs. If cleanup fails, keep writers stopped and retry. Never combine this with raw BullMQ auto-removal.

Cleanup cadence and incoming traffic determine the retained volume; a burst can exceed available memory even with an age policy. Operators own backlog alerts, PII minimization, external audit archives, backups and old legacy reservation migration. Resubmission after expiration can execute again. See [security policy](_media/SECURITY.md) and [retention decision](_media/2026-09-05-maintenance-decisions.md).

### Outbox state and shutdown ownership

| Observation | Meaning and owner |
| --- | --- |
| Outbox `SENT` | Outbox stored successful enqueue/dedupe acknowledgement; the job may still be waiting or may later fail. |
| Jobs `succeeded` / `failed` / `dead_letter` | Jobs handler outcome, independent of the Outbox row. |
| Enqueue committed but response lost | A stable-ID job may exist while Outbox remains PENDING/PROCESSING; retry the same source identity. |
| Mapping `unmapped: 'ignore'` | Intentional acknowledgement without creating a job; Outbox may become SENT. |
| Outbox claim recovery after process death | Outbox owns claim/lease recovery and retry budget. Jobs does not edit the source database. |
| Jobs shutdown admission error | The source publisher did not receive acknowledgement. Stop source dispatch before closing Jobs; do not spin retries during shutdown. |

A co-located Outbox poller must stop and settle all outstanding publisher callbacks **before** Nest closes Jobs. Default lifecycle phase ordering alone is insufficient: Jobs closes in `onModuleDestroy`, while the published Outbox poller stops in `onApplicationShutdown`. Arrange explicit shutdown orchestration before `app.close()`. A source shutdown timeout is not proof that callbacks settled; keep Jobs available while they settle, or terminate the unhealthy process so the source lease can recover. Do not repeatedly publish into closed Jobs and consume Outbox retry budget to FAILED. The required upstream stop/drain evidence is tracked in the maintenance plan and `TEN-ECO-NEXT`.

`JobsOutboxBridge` is deprecated and compatibility-only. It has no canonical source event ID or lineage fencing. First-party Outbox users should migrate to `createOutboxJobsPublisher()`.

All get/history/replay/discard APIs are trusted control-plane operations. For tenant-facing code, first authorize tenant membership, then filter the record:

```ts
await authorization.requireTenantAccess(principal, tenantId); // application-owned RBAC
const job = await jobs.getJobForTenant(jobId, tenantId);
if (!job) throw new NotFoundException();
// Invoke replay/discard only after separately authorizing that administrative operation.
```

A mismatched or missing ID returns null. Never accept the caller's tenant string as proof of authorization. Jobs introduces no RBAC dependency.

### Verification and exact candidates

`npm run test:coverage` requires a real `REDIS_URL` and fails immediately without it. Coverage artifacts include a tuple/ref summary; the branch contract covers activation/timeout ownership, tenant dedupe/lineage, portable validation, role admission, retention horizons and backend response loss. Run `node scripts/coverage-evidence.js` with the same Redis environment after coverage.

The 0.2.1 modern Outbox anchor is fixed. The separate candidate runner accepts a JSON manifest with `package`, exact `version` and expected SHA-512 `integrity`:

```sh
JOBS_TARBALL=/absolute/path/nestarc-jobs-0.3.1.tgz \
  node scripts/test-outbox-candidate-consumer.js /absolute/path/outbox-candidate.json
```

Floating versions and mismatched digests fail. Set `JOBS_TARBALL` for core/modern runners to verify the same candidate bytes; CI consumers download the one package-smoke artifact. The exact v5 Redis matrix is BullMQ 5.76.2 and 5.81.4 using ioredis connections; newer node-redis/Bun adapters are not part of this support claim. `npm run test:policy` verifies workflow permissions and artifact identity policy. `npm run test:chaos` is opt-in and accepts only loopback disposable Redis; it kills only child processes it spawned. Redis restart additionally requires the exact owned compose project/container variables documented in the maintenance handoff. Keep chaos separate from other Redis runs.
